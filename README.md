UniRank Insight ML Driven University Forecasting

# Overview
This project harnesses the power of machine learning to predict university rankings. By analyzing various factors that influence these rankings, we've developed a model that can provide accurate predictions to help students and educators understand the dynamics of university rankings.

Key Features
* Data Collection: Sourced and refined data from diverse platforms to create a comprehensive dataset on university rankings and their influencing factors.
* Model Engineering: Implemented ML models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for prediction.
* Data Visualization: Leveraged tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data and gain actionable insights.
* Performance Metrics: Assessed model performance using F1, Precision, Recall, and R-squared metrics.

Technologies Used
* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib & Seaborn

Results & Findings
* Identified key factors like faculty quality, research output, and student satisfaction as major influencers in rankings.
* Benchmarked various algorithms to determine the optimal model for prediction.
